# Verification_enviornment_for_FIFO
The "FIFO Basic Operation" test case is designed to verify the fundamental functionality of a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory. The test steps cover initialization, data writing, verification of data writing order, data reading, verification of data reading order, and testing boundary conditions such as overflow and underflow scenarios. 
A test case for a D flip-flop called "D Flip-Flop Basic Operation" has been outlined. This test case verifies the fundamental functionality of the D flip-flop, ensuring that it correctly captures and outputs the D input on the rising edge of the clock signal. The test steps include initializing the flip-flop, applying inputs, verifying the output transitions, and repeating the process with different D input values to ensure consistent behavior. This test case helps ensure that the D flip-flop operates as expected in capturing and holding data with respect to clock edges.
