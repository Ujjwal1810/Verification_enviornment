# Verification_enviornment
The verification environment in SystemVerilog plays a crucial role in ensuring the functionality and correctness of digital designs. It serves as a comprehensive infrastructure where designers and verification engineers can thoroughly test and validate the behavior of the design under different scenarios. The verification environment encompasses a set of components and methodologies designed to automate the testing process, increase test coverage, and identify potential bugs early in the development cycle.
